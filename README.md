# calculatorStarterCode

This project does the mathematical calculations for you. It produces a calculator in which you input one integer, select the operation of your 
choice, input another integer, and then the program returns and prints the result at the bottom
of the web page. If I had more time, I'd write a program where the calculator uses parentheses
and takes more than one operation.
